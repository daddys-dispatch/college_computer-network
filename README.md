# Computer Network Lab Exercises

This repository contains Java programs and solutions for core computer network lab experiments.

---

## Lab 1: CRC Check

**Aim:**  
Write a Java code for error detection using CRC-CCITT (16-bits). The program calculates and verifies a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for digital data using binary division by a generator polynomial, demonstrating error detection during transmission.

## Lab 2: Sliding Window

**Aim:**  
Write a Java code for implementing the sliding window protocol in the data link layer. The program simulates sending and acknowledging multiple packets while managing window size and sliding, ensuring reliable and efficient flow control.

---

## Lab 3: Bellman-Ford

**Aim:**  
Write a Java code for finding the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The program computes shortest paths in weighted graphs from a source to all vertices and also detects negative edge cycles.

---

## Lab 4: File Transfer

**Aim:**  
Write a Java code for implementing a client-server program using TCP/IP sockets for file transfer. The client requests a file from the server, and the server transfers it back if available, demonstrating basic client-server communication.

---

## Lab 5: RSA Cryptosystem

**Aim:**  
Write a Java code for implementing the RSA public key cryptosystem. The program generates keys, encrypts a plaintext message using the public key, and decrypts the ciphertext using the private key, demonstrating secure communication.
